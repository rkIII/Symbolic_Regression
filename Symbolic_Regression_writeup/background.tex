We later describe how we execute the reproduction, mutation, and crossover methods to produce generations, but we adapt a method called tournament selection to select individuals from Brad Miller and David Goldberg \cite{tournamentselection}. In this method, we calculate the probability of individuals being selected using their fitness values. Then, we choose a sample of the population and select the individual with the best fitness value. We continue to use tournament selection to choose individuals for the various methods of determining best fit.
