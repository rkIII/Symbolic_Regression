\label{sec:intro}



In this problem, we create a computer program to determine a mystery
function by using symbolic regression. To do this, we use genetic programming
to search for the best function that matches the mystery function.
In other words, we create a population of possible functions and use genetic programming to determine which function 
best matches the mystery function. To determine which function best matches the
mystery function, we assign each function a fitness value and use that to 
determine which function survives to the next generation. We use methods such
as crossover and mutation to improve the fittest functions, as described by John Koza \cite{genetic programming}. We are still working on our results, which will be briefly summarized in this section. In the following sections, we discuss the background of this problem, our experiment, and our results.
