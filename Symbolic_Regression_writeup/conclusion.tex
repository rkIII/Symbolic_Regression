\label{sec:concl}



In this paper, we use genetic programming to implement symbolic regression. We perform symbolic regression on data points to determine a mystery function f. We use reproduction, mutation, and crossover to improve each generation's fitness and find the individual that best represents the mystery function. We are working on the results, which will be briefly summarized in this section. In further studies, we would expand our function span to include trigonometric functions, non-integer powers of x, and non-integer constants.
